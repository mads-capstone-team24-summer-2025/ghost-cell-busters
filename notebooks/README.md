Ghost Cell Busters: A Comprehensive Analysis of Machine Learning for Tumor Cell Identification
Executive Summary
The "Ghost Cell Busters" project represents a sophisticated computational biology effort focused on developing robust machine learning models to accurately identify tumor cells from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The project systematically analyzes three distinct cancer datasets (GSE176078, GSE161529, and GSE180286) to create and validate predictive models for distinguishing tumor cells from normal cells. Beyond simple classification, the work examines oncogene expression patterns, pathway analysis, and potential therapeutic targets, providing multidimensional insights into cancer biology.

Project Overview and Objectives
The project employs a methodical approach to developing tumor cell classifiers that can generalize across multiple datasets. The key objectives include:

Building machine learning models for tumor cell classification using GSE176078 as the training dataset
Validating and cross-applying these models on independent datasets (GSE161529 and GSE180286)
Analyzing differential gene expression between predicted tumor and normal cells
Examining oncogene activation patterns and relevant signaling pathways
Identifying potential therapeutic targets through network biology approaches
Correlating tumor predictions with genomic instability measures like CNV scores
Dataset Description
The project utilizes three primary datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO):

GSE176078: Used as the training dataset for model development, contains scRNA-seq data with labeled tumor and normal cells
GSE161529: A breast cancer dataset containing numerous samples spanning normal tissue, primary tumors, and metastatic tissue
GSE180286: Another cancer dataset used for model validation and oncogene analysis
Each dataset is thoroughly processed with quality control measures, normalization steps, and feature extraction to prepare for machine learning applications and downstream analyses.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
The preprocessing workflow follows a consistent pattern across all three datasets:

Loading raw scRNA-seq data and associated metadata
Quality control filtering including cell count normalization and mitochondrial gene percentage assessment
Feature extraction including cell cycle scoring and CNV (Copy Number Variation) score calculation
Creation of observation files (.obs) containing cell-level metadata
Gene symbol annotation using MyGene.info to standardize gene identifiers
The data preparation meticulously handles technical challenges such as batch effects, cell quality filtering, and gene annotation to ensure reliable downstream analysis.

Machine Learning Model Development
The project develops XGBoost-based models for tumor cell classification:

Model Training (GSE176078): The primary classifier is trained using features including gene expression patterns, cell cycle scores, mitochondrial content, and other cellular characteristics.

Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics demonstrates strong performance (over 95% weighted average F1-score).

Model Interpretation: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides feature importance insights, revealing that both gene expression patterns and cell cycle metrics contribute significantly to tumor cell classification.

Cross-validation: The model undergoes rigorous k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability.

Model Application and Validation
The models are subsequently applied to independent datasets:

Cross-dataset Validation: The trained model from GSE176078 is applied to GSE161529 and GSE180286 to test generalizability.

Threshold Optimization: Classification thresholds are fine-tuned to balance sensitivity and specificity across different datasets.

Orthogonal Validation: CNV scores serve as an independent validation measure, with statistical tests confirming significantly higher CNV scores in predicted tumor cells.

Oncogene Expression Analysis
Extensive analysis of oncogene expression patterns includes:

Differential Expression: Statistical comparison of expression levels between predicted tumor and normal cells using t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests.

Visualization: Heatmaps, violin plots, and UMAPs illustrate expression differences across cell populations.

Log2 Fold Change Calculation: Quantification of expression differences for key oncogenes and tumor suppressors.

Pathway and Network Analysis
The project applies sophisticated network biology approaches:

Pathway Enrichment: GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) identifies significantly enriched pathways in tumor cells.

Network Visualization: NetworkX-based visualization illustrates activation patterns in key oncogenic pathways including PI3K–MAPK–EGFR, CDK4–CDK6–CCND1, and MYC signaling axes.

Druggable Target Identification: Integration with known drug targets provides therapeutic context to the network analysis.

Key Findings
Model Performance and Validation
The tumor cell classification models demonstrate strong performance metrics:

The primary XGBoost classifier achieves approximately 89% accuracy with a 94% F1-score for tumor cell detection in the GSE176078 dataset.

Cross-validation confirms the model's stability across different data partitions.

Application to independent datasets shows the model successfully generalizes to new data sources.

CNV score analysis provides orthogonal validation of tumor predictions, with predicted tumor cells showing significantly higher CNV scores (p-value < 0.001), consistent with genomic instability as a hallmark of cancer.

Oncogene Expression Patterns
The analysis reveals distinct expression patterns in predicted tumor cells:

Highly Expressed Oncogenes: Several key oncogenes show significant upregulation in predicted tumor cells, including:

CCND1 (log2FC: ~1.12)
CDK4 (log2FC: ~0.91)
CDK6 (log2FC: ~0.89)
MYC (log2FC: ~0.97)
MDM2 (log2FC: ~2.95)
Activated Pathways: The data supports activation of multiple oncogenic pathways:

Cell cycle progression through the CDK4–CDK6–CCND1 axis
Growth signaling via the PI3K–MAPK–EGFR axis
Transcriptional amplification through the MYC signaling axis
Tumor Suppressor Patterns: Some tumor suppressors show downregulation in tumor cells, including TP53 (log2FC: ~-0.54).

Pathway Analysis and Network Biology
Network analysis provides deeper insights into tumor biology:

Integrated Signaling: The visualization of multiple signaling axes demonstrates interconnectedness between oncogenic pathways, with MYC influencing CDK4/6 expression and PI3K–MAPK signaling contributing to overall tumor phenotypes.

Druggable Targets: Several nodes in the networks represent actionable therapeutic targets with existing drugs, including:

CDK4/6 inhibitors (Palbociclib, Ribociclib, Abemaciclib)
EGFR inhibitors (Erlotinib)
PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors (Alpelisib, Capivasertib)
MDM2 inhibitors (Milademetan)
BCL2 inhibitors (Venetoclax)
Gene Set Enrichment: GSEA analysis confirms enrichment of cancer-associated pathways including KEGG and Reactome gene sets related to cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and oncogenic signaling.
